**Info regarding the creation of input features**

- Elements of table relevant:
    'Time' DateTime64
    'Symbol' Nullable(String)
    'Trade_Price' Nullable(Float64)
    'Date' Date
    'YearMonth' String

- Look at top ~15 traded companies in S&P500 and pick 5 tickers

- Working with intra-day features:
    *aggregate to a specifc frequency (1 or 5 minute frequency)
    *not just on previous returns, but also on the sequence of previous returns (??)
    *difference between last highest price and current price can be a feature (draw-ups/draw-downs)
    *from log price can compute difference between past highest price and current price if higher drawdown is 0 is not
    something else. Can create them at different frequencies
    *bi-power variation?
    *take trade price closest to the beginning of period (10:50), take price at 10:51, take logs of those prices and take
    difference
    *take fist difference of all those prices
